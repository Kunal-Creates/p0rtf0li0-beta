# Portfolio Beta

The second iteration of my portfolio. This version focused on refining the structure, improving accessibility, and experimenting with cleaner UI and slightly more interactivity.

## Highlights
- Improved responsiveness
- Clearer content sections
- Early integration of JavaScript and animations

> This version is where things started coming together â€” almost there, but still evolving.
